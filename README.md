# 🎓 Final Exam Calculator

This project contains two Python scripts to help students calculate the **final exam mark needed** to achieve a target grade (A- to A+), based on the weight of course components completed before the exam. It also allows you to **save results for multiple courses**.

- `file_output.py`  
  Saves the required final exam marks for multiple courses to a file.

## 🧠 How It Works

You input:
- The **weight** (in %) of the coursework completed before the exam.
- The **percentage of marks lost so far** (e.g., if you scored 40/45 of your mark (where your exam is 55%), you've lost 5% of your final mark).
- Any **bonuses** (in % of your final mark, you may needed you calculate this yourself)

The calculator tells you the **minimum final exam score** required to meet your goal.
